# Personal-Project
A repo storing the files for the puzzle platformer developed for my personal project

A simple game created for my personal project.
The creation of this required understanding Unity's systems and how gameObjects can be set to interact with each other
as well as tile maps, player input, game logic, and UI to provide a decent experience to the user
